Hello World!
This is my first project for TOP (The Odin Project) and it is called 'Odin Recipes'. The goal is to accomplish the following using HTML:
1. Create a home page 
2. Create an individual webpage for each of our recipes 
3. Add images for our recipes
4. link the recipes' webpages to the home page
